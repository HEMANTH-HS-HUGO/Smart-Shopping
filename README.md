# "SMART SHOPPING: PREDICTIVE PURCHASES â€œ WITH MACHINE LEARNING

*In the ever-evolving landscape of digital commerce, the phenomenon of online shopping has taken center stage in the daily lives of consumers. However, the ability to differentiate between casual website visitors and those with genuine purchase intent remains a pivotal challenge for online retailers. This project undertakes the task of developing a machine learning-based classifier capable of discerning a user's inclination to make a purchase during their online shopping journey.

*Leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing thousands of user sessions, the project incorporates various features, including the number of pages visited, the day of the week, the web browser in use, and an array of user behavior metrics. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm is employed to generate predictive insights.

*By successfully identifying and predicting user purchasing intent, this project holds the potential to revolutionize the way online shopping platforms engage with their users. The outcomes are expected to empower these platforms in offering tailor-made content and products, thereby elevating the overall user experience. This work represents a vital step toward optimizing digital commerce and driving revenue growth in the online retail industry.
